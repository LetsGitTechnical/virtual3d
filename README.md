# virtual3d

In this project, I will create a virtual three dimensional display using face tracking for head tracking. More specifically, I use the Haar Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a persons location relative to a webcam, I then update the display of the tunnel according to the user's position so that a 3d effect is given.
